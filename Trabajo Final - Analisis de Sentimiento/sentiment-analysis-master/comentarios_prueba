1- This was a very good movie, especially if you are a business person. I did not like how they made doing LSD something that looked intriguing, therefore some may want to try it. but it was interesting seeing how this whole business came about.

2 -Despite some very good-looking special effects and action sequences, the long stretches of boring dialog combined with a detestable, unnecessary, and grossly disappointing plot twist, make this a must-miss entry in the Marvel catalog.
